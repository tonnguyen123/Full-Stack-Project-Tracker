I deployed and hosted the website on free server on Render and MySQL on Clever Cloud so there will be delay in processing requests due to limit of Free User

The deployed website:
https://full-stack-ton-project-trackers.netlify.app/login

After login, the main page will show all projects created before. The percentage shows how much completion your team complete:

When you click 'View Project', it will load the created tasks that you created before and you can manage to change, update, delete them. You can also assign new task or edit the teamate who will take care of them as below. The graph below will show how progress of how much completion of the task is worked on. It will change when you update the completion percentage of the tasks:
